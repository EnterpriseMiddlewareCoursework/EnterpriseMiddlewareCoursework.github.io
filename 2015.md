## 1<sup>st</sup> International Workshop on Energy-aware Simulation (ENERGY-SIM’15)

### In-cooperation with ACM SIGSIM and IEEE TCGCC
ENERGY-SIM 2015 is an International workshop on energy­-aware simulations held in collaboration with SIMUtools 2015, and in-cooperatin with ACM SIGSIM and IEEE TCGCC. The workshop focuses on a broad range of research challenges in the area of energy­-aware simulations. Where simulation tools and techniques are used in order to better understand and model environments which include the use of energy. Energy research is an interdisciplinary field covering (but not limited to) sciences, engineering and computing sciences, and we encourage papers with such interdisciplinary elements.
